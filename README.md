# IHC Staining Quantification Software

This Python software can be used to quantify Immunohistochemistry staining intensity and positive cell density. The program uses OpenCV package to count the number of cells in the field and quantify positive staining signals. The software was implemented into user-friendly application using Tkinter Module. The program allows users to threshold positive staining based on their scans.

The IHC Staining Quantification Software can assist biologists in quantifying staining for research.
