# IHC Staining Quantification Software

This Python-based application enables accurate quantification of Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining intensity and positive cell density in tissue samples. Leveraging the OpenCV library, the software detects and counts cells within microscopic fields while measuring the extent of positive staining. A user-friendly interface built with the Tkinter module allows researchers to easily adjust staining thresholds based on their specific slide scans.

Designed to support biologists and researchers, this tool streamlines the analysis of IHC-stained tissues, making quantification more efficient, reproducible, and accessible.
